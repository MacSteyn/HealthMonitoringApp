The Health Monitoring System is a comprehensive Python application designed to assist users in tracking and analyzing essential health metrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, blood oxygen level, and weight. By enabling users to input their health data, the application not only saves this information in a CSV file but also checks for anomalies against predefined thresholds, alerting users to any potential health concerns. Additionally, it leverages machine learning algorithms, specifically logistic regression, to provide risk predictions based on historical data, enhancing users' ability to monitor their health proactively. The system also includes advanced visualizations that display health data trends and distributions, allowing users to make informed decisions about their well-being. This project aims to empower individuals to take charge of their health by providing an intuitive and informative platform for health monitoring and analysis
